# MIPS_project   
## Introduction   
This is the final project for the Digital Circuit Design course. The target is to implement a MIPS in verilog and synthesize, P&R the circuit. 
## Usage
For rtl-level simulation, in baseline/src:   
```
ncverilog Final_tb.v CHIP.v slow_memory.v +define+hasHazard +access+r
```   
##TODOs
Re-document the project in English.
